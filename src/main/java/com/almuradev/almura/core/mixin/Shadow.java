    /**
     * <p>In general, shadow methods can be declared using their name in the target class as you would expect, however we run into a problem when we
     * want to mix in a method with the same name and arguments, but a different return type to the shadow method. While the JVM itself will happily
     * support methods with signatures that differ only on return type, the compiler itself does not. This poses a problem, since we have no way to
     * leverage this behaviour since our mixin class will not compile.</p>
     *
     * <p>To circumvent this compiler limitation, the prefix option can be used. By specifying a prefix for the shadow method, it is subsequently
     * possible to compile the mixin class, the specified prefix will then be stripped from the method name prior to applying the mixin, and
     * everything will work as expected. You may either use the default prefix: "shadow$", or you may specify your own. It is good practice to
     * specify the prefix if you are using it, regardless of whether you use the default or not. For example consider the intrinsic readability of
     * the following snippets</p>:
     *
     * <blockquote><pre>
     *     &#64;Shadow abstract void someMethod(int arg1, int arg2);
     *     &#64;Shadow abstract void shadow$someMethod(int arg1, int arg2);
     *     &#64;Shadow(prefix = "shadow$") abstract void shadow$someMethod(int arg1, int arg2);
     *     &#64;Shadow(prefix = "foo$") abstract void foo$someMethod(int arg1, int arg2);
     * </pre></blockquote>
     *
     * <p>All of these declarations are semantically equivalent, however the third and fourth are the most expressive in terms of making their
     * intentions clear, and thus specifying prefix is recommended, since it aids readability and maintainability.<p>
     *
     * <p>Note that specifying a <em>prefix</em> does not <b>enforce</b> use of the prefix, the behaviour of <em>prefix</em> is such that the prefix
     * will be stripped from the start of the method name <em>as long as the method name actually starts with the prefix</em>! This has important
     * repercussions since if the annotation value does not match the method prefix then <em>no renaming will take place</em> likey resulting in
     * a failure state indicated by an {@link InvalidMixinException} at run time.</p>
